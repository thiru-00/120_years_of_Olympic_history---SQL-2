SQL Query Questions for Athlete Events and NOC Regions

This document contains a set of SQL query questions for comparing two tables: `athlete_events` and `noc_regions`. The questions are categorized by difficulty level.

Easy Questions

1. List all unique NOCs (National Olympic Committees) that are present in both tables.
2. Find how many athletes are associated with each NOC from the `athlete_events` table.
3. List all the athletes who participated in the Olympics representing a region but whose NOC is missing in the `noc_regions` table.
4. Find all athletes who competed in the Summer Olympics.
5. Retrieve the total number of regions that have at least one athlete in the `athlete_events` table.

Medium Questions

6. Display the number of athletes per region along with the NOC, showing only regions with more than 100 athletes.
7. List all athletes from countries or regions that do not have any notes (i.e., notes column is null) in the `noc_regions` table.
8. Find the regions and their NOC codes where athletes have won at least one medal.
9. Find all athletes who participated in multiple Olympic events and list their respective NOCs and regions.
10. Retrieve all athletes whose NOCs have additional notes listed in the `noc_regions` table.
11. Count the number of medals won by athletes from each region (consider Gold, Silver, and Bronze separately).
12. Identify the regions where the average height and weight of athletes are above the global average.

Hard Questions

13. List all athletes who have participated in both Summer and Winter Olympics, along with their NOC and region.

15. For each year of the Olympics, identify the region that won the most gold medals.
16. Identify the athletes who participated in an Olympic event representing a region different from their native region (using NOC and region mismatch).
17. List all athletes who have participated in more than 5 Olympic events and categorize them by region and medal count.
18. Rank the top 10 regions by the total number of medals won, and include the breakdown by Gold, Silver, and Bronze.
